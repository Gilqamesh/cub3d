1. Player's direction vector and the camera's plane vector getting updated with sin/cos, might need to readjust them once
	in a while to avoid losing precision so that they are perpendicular to each other
2. The macro named FPS doesn't really make sense, rework movespeed and rotspeed
3. Implement line draw function and replace utils/verLine
4. Floor/Ceiling textures are misaligned for some reason from the wall, they appear to be ~swimming
